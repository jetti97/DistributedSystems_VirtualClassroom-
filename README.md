# DistributedSystems_VirtualClassroom- 
The "Distributed Chat System: Virtual Classroom" project aims to create a robust and reliable communication system tailored for virtual classrooms. In the era of digital transformation, real-time communication between educators and students is essential for fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange.

This system is designed to address key challenges in distributed systems, including dynamic participant discovery, consistent message delivery, and fault tolerance.
This project combines theoretical principles of distributed systems with a practical application in education. It lays the groundwork for future enhancements, such as improved scalability, advanced security measures, and interactive features, to further enrich the virtual classroom experience.
